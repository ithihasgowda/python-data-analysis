Netflix Movie Analysis Using Python
Analyzing Netflix movies with Python involves data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to uncover trends and insights.

Key Python Libraries Used
Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning and manipulation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating charts and statistical graphics.

Data Cleaning Process
The cleaning process addresses missing values, inconsistent formats, duplicates, and incorrect datatypes:

Convert columns to appropriate types (e.g., dates, categories).

Standardize genres and movie titles using string methods and regular expressions.

Analytical Goals & Methods
Movies with Highest/Lowest Vote Counts: Sort the dataset by vote count to identify both extremes using Pandas' sort_values() or the Counter class for tallying votes.

Movies Released Each Year: Use value_counts() or groupby() on the release year column to get yearly counts.

Genre with Most Movies: Explode multi-genre fields and tally using value_counts() to identify the most common genre.

Visualization Techniques
Bar charts and histograms visualize yearly releases and genre distribution.

Scatter plots or lists show top and bottom vote-getters.

Movies per Year:

df['release_year'].value_counts().sort_index()

Most Popular Genre:

Explode multiple genres if present, then count occurrences.

Insights
Highest and Lowest Vote Counts: Revealed by sorting the vote_count column.

Movies per Year: Grouping by release_year identifies trends

Dominant Genre: Calculated by tallying genres after cleaning; the genre with the most entries is identified as most popular.

This approach, leveraging Pythonâ€™s robust data and visualization libraries, provides a repeatable workflow for exploring movie datasets and gaining actionable insight
